## Welcome
**<p>Sketchware 2D Game Engine or S2DGE designed to simplify game development within Sketchware, enabling users to create 2D games.</p>**
<p>Sketchware 2D Game Engine is a framework or toolkit developed within the constraints of Sketchware, a drag-and-drop app builder for Android. It provided the essential tools and functionalities to build 2D games directly in Sketchware by leveraging the platform's block-based coding environment and custom logic.</p>
<p>This engine offered ready-to-use features like sprite animation, collision detection, physics simulation, and event handling, effectively transforming Sketchware into a basic game development platform.</p>
<p>Whether you're a beginner exploring game development or an experienced Sketchware user looking to expand your creativity, this engine provides the tools you need to build exciting 2D games efficiently.</p>

## How It Works
The engine integrates seamlessly into Sketchware by providing pre-configured blocks and templates that allow developers to:
1.  Define game objects and their behaviors.
2.  Add or customize the logic for movement, collisions, and animations.
3.  Test and debug directly within the Sketchware app.
Using custom blocks, the engine handles complex tasks like rendering sprites and calculating collisions, making the development process faster and more beginner-friendly.

## Release
Ofc its empty, dont ask me when to release, but ask me "can i join the development?" instead xD
<p>
  Or you can visit <a href="https://web.sketchub.in/p/808">S2DGE on Sketchub</a> for the previous version
