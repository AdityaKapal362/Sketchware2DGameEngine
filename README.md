## Welcome
**<p>Sketchware 2D Game Engine or S2DGE designed to simplify game development within Sketchware, enabling users to create 2D games.</p>**
<p>Sketchware 2D Game Engine is a framework or toolkit developed within the constraints of Sketchware, a drag-and-drop app builder for Android. It provided the essential tools and functionalities to build 2D games directly in Sketchware by leveraging the platform's block-based coding environment and custom logic.</p>
<p>This engine offered ready-to-use features like sprite animation, collision detection, physics simulation, and event handling, effectively transforming Sketchware into a basic game development platform.</p>
